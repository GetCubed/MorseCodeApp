Convert text to Morse Code that normally uses on and off clicks, tones, or lights. Morse code transmits text information.  
The recipient can understand the message without additional decoding equipment.  
Morse code covers Latin letters with some extensions for non-Latin letters, Arabic numbers, and punctuation.  
Dits refer to dots.  Dahs defer to dashes. These dits/dots and dahs/dashes provide the code.  
Some applications include amateur radio and aeronautical aids such as VORs. 
SOS is a common distress signal using three dashes and three dots and uses Morse code.


 
An observer can understand Morse code without special equipment which can be an advantage in, for example, an emergency situation.  
This code can also be useful when poor signal conditions exist, and the human voice is difficult to decode. 


While this code covers the basic Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals, extensions to the code cover languages that use more than the Latin alphabet letters.


Samuel Morse developed the foundation for Morse code in the 1800s when he worked with an electrical telegraph system sending pulses of electric current 
and an electromagnet. His code used the pulse and breaks between them to transmit information.  Popular with amateur radio operators, 
this code is no longer required if you want to get a U.S. pilots or air traffic controller license, though these individuals often have a 
basic understanding of the code.
